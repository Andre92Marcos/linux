A file descriptor (FD) in Unix/Linux operating systems is an indicator of connection maintained by the kernel to perform Input/Output (I/O) operations.

By default, the first three file descriptors in Linux are:

	Data Stream for Input
	STDIN – 0
	Data Stream for Output
	STDOUT – 1
	Data Stream for Output that relates to an error occurring.
	STDERR – 2
